My name is Peter Brown and I'm a Ruby and Rails developer from Burlington, Vermont
with a strong passion for software craftsmanship. I build [web applications at Agilion](http://agilion.com/), and
enjoy [helping people solve problems](http://stackoverflow.com/users/167614/beerlington),
[tweeting about cats](https://twitter.com/beerlington),
[writing and sharing code](https://github.com/beerlington), and [wearing suits](http://www.linkedin.com/in/p3t3r).

I co-founded both the [Burlington Web Application Group](http://www.btvwag.org/)
and the [Burlington Ruby Group](http://burlingtonruby.org/), and organize
the annual [Burlington Ruby Conference](http://burlingtonruby.com/).
