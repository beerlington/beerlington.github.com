    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever had an experience where you started to write some code only to discover that the code already existed? &ldquo;Woah&rdquo; you think to yourself as you fire off &ldquo;git blame&rdquo; to figure out which one of your coworkers deserves a full-force high five. Low and behold, your own name shows up as the author, and your mind is blown because you have no memory of writing it.</p>

<p>You, my friend, just had a Bill and Ted Experience.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I went to a <a href="http://www.vermonttechnologyalliance.org/events/event_details.asp?id=308176&amp;group=">VTTA Lunch and Learn</a>
meeting last week focused on &ldquo;Marketing Vermont as a technology state&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;ve had some time to reflect on this objective and wanted to talk about some of the frustrations I&rsquo;ve felt in
trying to address this very issue.</p>

<p>During the lunch session, David Parker of Dealer.com described how Vermont&rsquo;s
greatest opportunity to grow our economy is through the technology sector.
Vermont’s tourism revenue accounts for a small minority of its GDP, yet our
state&rsquo;s marketing is disproportionately focused on tourism.
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4yr58Xga2A">In his presentation</a>,
Parker expressed that we need to get better at educating
people in science and technology, finding startup capital, and retaining a young
energetic workforce. Instead of proposing concrete actions though, he suggests
&ldquo;changing the rhetoric&rdquo; by talking about what Vermont has to offer. While I
agree with his message, unfortunately talk is cheap and ideas are free, and
neither is worth shit unless you actually stand up and do something.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, getting the word out about these great jobs and companies is not
enough to attract people to our state. One individual at the meeting went as
far as suggesting that every ad in Vermont Life magazine should feature a
cellphone or laptop. Are you kidding me? Vermont is a beautiful place, let&rsquo;s
not change that. Can there not be a balance between technology and Vermont&rsquo;s
simple beauty without the two interfering with the other?</p>

<p>One topic that was missing from the lunch discussion was the role that community
plays in this endeavour. Yes, technology jobs and businesses are undeniably
important, but community is what gives people a sense of belonging. Do artists
and musicians live here because Vermont has one of the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm">lowest unemployment rates in the country</a>?
No, they live here because there is a community that
supports them. The role of community in the technology sector is no different.</p>

<h2>Community is an Investment, Not an Overnight Success</h2>

<p>Many Americans prefer band-aids to solve problems and don&rsquo;t consider future
repercussions of today&rsquo;s decisions. Why should we invest in renewable energy
when we can solve our immediate energy needs with fossil fuels? Why should we
pay higher taxes when corporations can sponsor our highways? Vermonters are
different. We don&rsquo;t want billboards taking away from Vermont&rsquo;s beauty. We would
rather pay $15 for a hamburger made from locally raised cows than $4 for a
Big Mac. More importantly though, our small communities thrive because they&rsquo;re not
looking for short term payoff. Community, like renewable energy, is a long
term investment and not a band-aid.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m organizing a software developer conference this summer called the
<a href="http://burlingtonruby.com/">Burlington Ruby Conference</a>.
Last year was our first time hosting the event and it attracted
80 developers for a weekend of networking and education in Burlington. Only about
25% of the attendees were from Vermont. The rest were from Boston, Montreal,
New York, and other parts of New England. We even had two guys from Denmark and
one from Mississippi. We also had a small number of women attend, but this year we have
been putting a lot of energy into increasing that number. We reached out to the
female developer and speaker communities, published a <a href="http://burlingtonruby.com/diversity.html">diversity statement</a> and
<a href="http://burlingtonruby.com/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>, and have teamed up with
<a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/burlington">Girl Develop It</a> to offer low cost
training in conjunction with the conference. What other technology event in
Vermont can make similar claims?</p>

<p>This year we&rsquo;ve reached out to numerous Vermont companies soliciting sponsorship
for the conference and have been met with the same response each time. &ldquo;Sorry,
not interested. We don&rsquo;t do Ruby, we do _____&rdquo;. Fill in the blank with
Java, .Net, LOLCODE, whatever. That&rsquo;s great, but these companies are obviously
missing the point. When was the last time there was a Java or .Net conference of this caliber in Vermont?
This is an opportunity to support the very community that these
companies are trying to hire from. Just because a developer writes Java code
to pay the bills, doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean he or she wants to do this in their
free time. If you look at the
<a href="http://burlingtonruby.org/buruco2012/">speakers we had last year</a>, it clearly wasn&rsquo;t all
about Ruby. We had talks on building location based apps, database scaling,
and multiple JavaScript talks from some of the most respected people in these fields.</p>

<p>Why have a Ruby conference then you ask? Simple. The Ruby community as a whole
represents the type of community that we know will thrive in Vermont. The people
are passionate, helpful, and strong advocates for diversity. Ruby developers
also tend to be at the forefront of best practices. Combined, these characteristics
lead to a vibrant, successful community. Just look at the number of other
<a href="http://lanyrd.com/topics/ruby/">regional Ruby conferences</a> that have sprung
up in the last few years. Ruby may not be the
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/03/why-ruby.html">cool language anymore</a>,
but the community is thriving. In my years of being a
Ruby developer, I&rsquo;ve never met someone who said they only use Ruby because it
pays the bills.</p>

<p>This conference is going to happen whether we have local support or not. We are
fortunate to live in a city where our costs to organize the event will be covered
by ticket sales alone. We&rsquo;ve also added a crowd-sourced fundraising effort
called &ldquo;<a href="http://burlingtonruby.com/cat.html">Burlington Ruby Cats</a>&rdquo;
that is not only raising money for the conference,
but also for the Humane Society of Chittenden County. Having sponsors would allow
us to do things above and beyond what a typical conference can offer such as
scholarships for students and underrepresented groups like women and minorities.
Equally as important though, having support from local sponsors shows that these
companies actually care about our community. We are not organizing this
conference to make money, infact we will be lucky if we break even given
everything we want to do. We are hosting a lakeside BBQ and providing professional
recordings of the talks free of charge. We are organizing the conference because
we want to invest in our community. We want people to think about this conference
when they think of Burlington, Vermont; thereby helping to achieve our goal of
&ldquo;Marketing Vermont as a technology state&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the Vermont software community as it stands today is awesome.
I participated in (<a href="http://beerlington.github.io/blog/2012/10/21/how-we-won-hackvt/">and won</a>)
the 2nd annual Vermont Hackathon last October. This
event was targeted toward Vermont developers and the amount of support that local
businesses gave was incredible. This was a great success for our community,
but we can&rsquo;t limit ourselves to a handful of these events a year, or only focus
on the business side of Vermont&rsquo;s technology economy.</p>

<p>I also help organize a number of different software related user groups in the
Burlington area. Our first group, the <a href="http://www.btvwag.org/">Burlington Web Application Group</a>
(BTVWAG) typically has 30-50 people at any given meetup, and our latest group,
<a href="http://burlingtonjs.org/">Burlington JS</a>, filled all 35 of its slots in the first day it was announced.
These groups are run by volunteers and represent exactly what our technology
community is about.</p>

<p>People ask me after every meetup how they can get involved, but then I never hear
back from them. Step up folks! Acknowledging that we have a problem is the first
step, but taking action is the only way that things will change. There are a
number of community members who get this and have devoted countless hours of their free
time to building the community. Aside from the hackathon,
<a href="http://vtcodecamp.org/">Vermont Code Camp</a>, <a href="http://www.techjamvt.com/">Vermont Tech Jam</a>,
and <a href="http://btvgig.org/">BTVGig</a> are other examples of events and initiatives led by
passionate Vermonters who want to see our community grow. We also have folks
like Jen Mincar at <a href="http://www.officesquaredvt.com/">Office Squared</a> who provide
places for these groups to gather, free of charge.</p>

<p>Vermont has jobs and an incredible opportunity for growth through technology,
so now is the time to start investing in our community, and investing in our
future. Please <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington">reach out</a> if you want to
join us in building a strong foundation for Vermont&rsquo;s technology future.</p>

    <link href="http://beerlington.github.io/blog/2012/10/21/how-we-won-hackvt/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-21T20:21:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://beerlington.github.io/blog/2012/10/21/how-we-won-hackvt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post describes how our team, <strong>Datamorphosis</strong>, won the <a href="http://hackvt.com/">HackVT hackathon</a>, and the strategy we used to ensure that if we didn’t win, we’d at least be proud of what we built. Read on to find out how we formed our team, brainstormed an idea, researched and planned our application, executed during the event, which technologies we used, and how we presented our winning application: <strong>The Vermont Business Landscape</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="http://petebrown-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vermont-business-landscape-datamorphosis.png" alt="Insert App screenshot" /></p>

<h2>Forming a Team</h2>

<p>Hackathons are not just about writing code. They are about solving a problem in the most succinct way possible, and effectively communicating the problem and solution in a remarkably short period of time. Having the right team is critical to accomplishing that goal. There are very few people in this world who alone can brainstorm an idea, aggregate complex data, build APIs, design a usable interface, and present their work in front of a judging audience. The rest of us are mere mortals. Forming a solid team is about understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each member, and how they will fit together.</p>

<h3>Our Team:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://adambouchard.info">Adam Bouchard</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/alanpeabody">Alan Peabody</a></li>
<li><a href="http://katiemccurdy.com/">Katie McCurdy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickberkeley">Patrick Berkeley</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington">Peter Brown</a> (me!)</li>
</ul>


<p>Combined, our team was highly skilled in web design and development, data analysis, user experience, and communication; precisely the skills needed to succeed in a hackathon. Almost every member of our team had previously worked with another member at some point in the past. We understood each other’s strengths and weaknesses and knew exactly how each person could contribute. This allowed us to trust one another and stay focused on the tasks that we were most qualified for.</p>

<h2>Brainstorming and Planning</h2>

<p>When selecting our data set, there was one theme that seemed to resonate with our team: <em>Incorporating data that was challenging to aggregate and analyze</em>. The reason for this is that many successful business models are built around simplifying a tedious task. Our team believes in the value of small businesses to Vermont’s economy, and in doing research, we discovered that the state has a need for aggregating business data from disparate data sources. The <a href="http://burlingtonvt.gov/cedo/">Community &amp; Economic Development Office</a> receives frequent inquiries from prospective new business owners as to the health of various sectors throughout Vermont.</p>

<p>Once we had a vague idea that we wanted to build a tool to assist new business owners, we began to research and plan our application. Our team met a few times during the week leading up to the hackathon, and used <a href="https://flowdock.com/">Flowdock</a> to discuss ideas (even when we were in the same room).</p>

<h3>Here are a few of the areas that we researched:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Market need</strong> &ndash; If you’re trying to solve a problem for someone other than yourself, find a real person who has this problem. Talk to them and see how passionate they are about it. In our case, the person we spoke with at the Community &amp; Economic Development Office was ecstatic about our proposed solution. This validated our idea and gave us confidence going into to the competition.</li>
<li><strong>Judges</strong> &ndash; Information about each judge was available on the <a href="http://hackvt.com/#details">HackVT website</a>. We discussed as a team what sort of things they might be looking for, and planned to account for this in our application. For example, <a href="http://cutroni.com/blog/">Justin Cutroni</a> works on the Google Analytics team, and we assumed that analyzing and simplifying complex data was something he is passionate about.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> &ndash; Spending time up front discussing and researching technologies is well worth the effort. After choosing an idea, we made a list of all the potential tools we might need to build it. Members of our team had overlapping skill sets so we were able to make some important decisions before the competition began.</li>
<li><strong>How to win a hackathon</strong> &ndash; We even spent some time researching <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4345295">how other people won hackathons</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Execution</h2>

<p>Given the amount of upfront work we did, we were able to start the hackathon with confidence and direction. We knew who was doing what, and essentially hit the ground running. We made a couple mistakes along the way and had to pivot a few times, but overall we were able to stay focused on our goal and finish within the allotted time.</p>

<p><img src="http://petebrown-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/public/datamorphosis-at-work.jpg" alt="Datamorphosis team at work" /></p>

<h3>What we learned:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Start early</strong> &ndash; Though the hackathon didn’t officially kick off until 6PM, they allowed teams to set up and start coding at 3pm. These early hours in the competition are critical. Everyone is awake and can make reasonable decisions, and being there early makes things a little less stressful.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid perfection</strong> &ndash; This is a hackathon, and it’s ok to write hacky code. People who know me or have seen some of <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/beerlington">my presentations</a> know that I’m a stickler for good code. Building a production application for your customers is one thing, but hacking something in 24 hours for a three minute presentation is another. Put aside your pride and just get it done.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the core</strong> &ndash; Since you will likely run into unexpected hiccups along the way, focus on building the core first and iterate on it. Will your application still function and be presentable without feature X? If so, it’s a low priority. In our case, showing data on a time-lapse map was the core of our application. Without this, it would not have met our goals. We tracked a list of our priorities on a whiteboard and delegated each task in order of importance. By focusing on these must-have features, we were able to have a simple application that was easy to finish and demonstrate.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t panic</strong> &ndash; When we are tired and under stress, we tend to make bad decisions. Our team encountered a serious bug in the final hour and realized we didn’t have time to fix it, so we prepared our presentation accordingly. We spent our last 30 minutes planning a path to walk through the application that we knew we could demonstrate with confidence.</li>
<li><strong>Know when to cut a feature</strong> &ndash; This goes along with focusing on core functionality. Some features will take up too much of your time and don’t add enough value. If it doesn’t feel right, cut your losses and move on. We had a few awesome features that we decided to axe at the last minute. If you’ve prioritized your todo list, the tasks ranked as “nice to have” will likely get pulled.</li>
<li><strong>Design for presentation</strong> &ndash; Chances are, your application is going to look 100x worse on a large, lower contrast projector screen during the presentation. We planned for this by using large, readable fonts and designing simple interface. If the judges can’t make out what it is, it will just be visually distracting.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous communication</strong> &ndash; Even when we were sitting at the same table during the event, we continued using Flowdock to communicate. We found this asynchronous form of communication to be vital to our productivity, allowing people to propose ideas, share links, and notify others about code changes, without breaking from their workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t bother with user authentication</strong> &ndash; No one cares that you added a 3rd party authentication system to your app. If your application isn’t secure for the presentation, this is actually a good thing because you won’t be wasting valuable time trying to remember your password.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>In planning for the event, we anticipated having at least five minutes to present our idea. It turned out we only had three. Three minutes is not a lot of time for anything, let alone present a problem, solution and walk through a software demo. Every second is valuable and should be spent selling your idea to the judges.</p>

<p><img src="http://petebrown-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/public/presenting-at-hackvt.jpg" alt="presenting at HackVT" /></p>

<h3>Here are some tips for nailing the presentation:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Get some rest</strong> &ndash; With a five person team, we had the luxury of making sure the people representing our team were well rested. Only two of my teammates actually coded through the night. It’s easy to make stupid mistakes when you’re tired, and you don’t want to blow all your hard work in the last 3 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Practice your pitch</strong> &ndash; Our presenters spent hours preparing for the demo. They practiced what they were going to say and how everything was going to flow. This extra effort definitely paid off in the end.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t talk about the technology</strong> &ndash; You’re here to brag about your application, not about the tools you used. If people are interested in what you built it in, they will ask.</li>
<li><strong>No one built a perfect application</strong> &ndash; I’m sure everyone’s application had at least one embarrassing bug. Ours had at least three that we were aware of. Don’t apologize and bring attention to these faults, the judges probably won’t even notice. We planned our demo to avoid these issues, and no one besides us knew they existed.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on your product</strong> &ndash; Don’t rely on presentation slides to help sell your app. Though most of the judges looked well rested, everyone else is tired and just wants to see your application in action.</li>
<li><strong>Just because you built it, doesn’t mean you have to show it</strong> &ndash; There were quite a few features we developed that did not even get mentioned during our demo. They would have been great to show off if we had a few more minutes, but they were not polished and did not really add core value.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Winning the hackathon means so much more to our team than the cash or prizes. HackVT was by far the most well organized Vermont event I have ever attended. Every last detail, from the quality of food to the mounted, decorative data sets, made the developers feel welcome and comfortable during our 24 hour stay. This event demonstrated the level of commitment that companies like MyWebGrocer and Dealer.com have made to Vermont, ensuring our state becomes a sustainable technology hub and attract talented individuals for years to come. Thank you to all the volunteers, sponsors, and participants who made it happen. See you again in 2013!</p>
