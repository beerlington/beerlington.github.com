<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a few great posts today from people reflecting on some of their
accomplishments and favorite things from 2013, so I was inspired to put
something together myself. Instead of just listing things off, I thought
it would be fun to go through <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington">my Twitter feed</a>
and pull out some of my favorite tweets. Some of them were
accomplishments, others were fun things I did, and some were just
ridiculous things that popped into my head. Hope you enjoy!</p>

<h2>On Quitting My Job</h2>

<p>The end of 2012 was not a great time for me. Lots of things were going
well in my life, but I knew I was not happy at my current job. I wasn&rsquo;t
learning anything, I was constantly frustrated, and to be honest, I was
pretty depressed. I decided to quit my job and form a partnership with
some of my coworkers doing contract web development through our <a href="http://agilion.com/">own company</a>.</p>

<p>This was exactly the change that I needed. Working remotely has had a
hugely positive impact on my life. It&rsquo;s given me freedom and
flexibility, challenged me with new and exciting projects,
and just made me an overall happier person. I live in VT for the quality
of life, and now I feel like I am able to enjoy it more than ever.</p>

<h2>On Having a Sick Dog</h2>

<p>The beginning of 2013 was an exciting time for me with the new job,
however, my dog got really sick the week I started. We didn&rsquo;t know what
was wrong with him for a few days. Then finally&hellip;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Sick dog mystery solved! Apparently his digestive system was no match for a 4 inch pine cone. Hoping for a quick recovery :)</p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/292772738689560576">January 19, 2013</a></blockquote>


<p>The poor guy had to spend the evening at the emergency vet recovering,
making sure he didn&rsquo;t have any real damage from the pine cone. He
did make a swift recovery though, and was back on his feet in no time.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Nothing beats a Saturday night at the emergency vet :( <a href="http://t.co/C5aJjsyJ">pic.twitter.com/C5aJjsyJ</a></p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/292857981207474176">January 20, 2013</a></blockquote>


<h2>On Feeling Better</h2>

<p>Speaking of not feeling well, I gave up dairy in the fall of 2012.
It wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted to do, but was something I needed to do. I had been feeling sick on and off for
a number of years, and finally decided enough was enough, and gave it up
entirely. 2013 was the first full year on a dairy free diet and I can
truly say I&rsquo;ve never felt this well in my entire life. I&rsquo;ve lost a ton of
weight and am cold pretty much constantly, but it&rsquo;s a small price to
pay to actually feel well.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&quot;It&#39;s gonna be a good vacation because now you know you&#39;re allergic to dairy&quot; - wife</p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/302495058689683457">February 15, 2013</a></blockquote>


<h2>On Holding Babies</h2>

<p>I feel like everywhere I look, someone is having a baby, and for whatever
reason, people really like holding them. I had never held one before,
so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. No one told me what to
do with it, and I figured you can&rsquo;t pet it like a cat, so I just tried
my hardest not to drop it.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Held my first baby today, like a pro. I couldn&#39;t get him to stop squirming though. I think I&#39;ll stick with cats. <a href="http://t.co/S48Kit8NDY">pic.twitter.com/S48Kit8NDY</a></p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/307942043588653056">March 2, 2013</a></blockquote>


<h2>On Being Sad (Panda)</h2>

<p>A friend/neighbor/former coworker of mine lost his dog in March.
And by lost, I mean he died. I was sitting by Gordie&rsquo;s side during
the final moments of his life, and it was one of the saddest things I&rsquo;ve
ever seen. This experience made me appreciate the things I have more
than ever.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Gonna miss you Gordie :( RIP <a href="http://t.co/m0rZ5p4Yyk">pic.twitter.com/m0rZ5p4Yyk</a></p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/315474527742197761">March 23, 2013</a></blockquote>


<h2>On Taking Vacations</h2>

<p>My wife and I went on some fun vacations this year. Despite my immense
fear of flying and rattlesnakes, my wife convinced me to fly out to Big
Sur, CA where they apparently have rattlesnakes everywhere. It was like
snakes on a plane, except the snakes weren&rsquo;t on the plane (that I knew
of).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>OMFG a rattlesnake! <a href="http://t.co/XQnyknJu48">pic.twitter.com/XQnyknJu48</a></p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/324992311517925379">April 18, 2013</a></blockquote>


<p>We also went to Bar Harbor, ME in the fall. We&rsquo;ve been going there every
year since our honeymoon, and plan to go back again in 2014. My wife and
I are both originally from Cape Cod, so I think what attracts us here is the
combination of mountains and ocean. Acadia National park a beautiful place!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Current status <a href="http://t.co/RMCY52VH61">pic.twitter.com/RMCY52VH61</a></p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/376451354866515968">September 7, 2013</a></blockquote>


<h2>On Selling Drugs</h2>

<p>The series finale of Breaking Bad wouldn&rsquo;t be for another 4 months, but
my neighbors were cooking up a storm of meth right down the street from
me. I live in a quiet residential neighborhood just North of downtown
Burlington, and never would have thought to see something like this.
Turns out they had been cooking meth with their child in the apartment.
Pretty fucked up shit.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Holy shit I think they&#39;re busting a meth lab a few houses down from me <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23btv&amp;src=hash">#btv</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23breakingbad&amp;src=hash">#breakingbad</a> <a href="http://t.co/5I1YEBZzCI">pic.twitter.com/5I1YEBZzCI</a></p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/335067219153281024">May 16, 2013</a></blockquote>


<h2>On Receiving Tweet of the Week</h2>

<p>The optimist in me got &ldquo;tweet of the week&rdquo; in <a href="http://www.7dvt.com/">Seven Days</a>
last summer. It wasn&rsquo;t my favorite tweet of the year, but I think it
sums up the weather in VT pretty well. As I&rsquo;m typing this, we&rsquo;re looking
at a low of -14&deg;F this week. I also thought up &ldquo;ForeverAloneSquare&rdquo;,
which was my response to people who tweet FourSquare checkins. Please
stop doing this folks. If I wanted to know where you were, I&rsquo;d use
FourSquare.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I just unlocked the &quot;<a href="https://twitter.com/Seven_Days">@Seven_Days</a> tweet of the week&quot; badge on ForeverAloneSquare! <a href="http://t.co/MqBrM3YJfR">pic.twitter.com/MqBrM3YJfR</a></p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/342339674645356544">June 5, 2013</a></blockquote>


<h2>On My Dog Turning 5</h2>

<p>I love my dog. I mean the cats are great and all, but bonding with a dog has
been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Sebastian turned
5 this summer and I&rsquo;m hoping he makes it past my 40th birthday to see
what I look like when I&rsquo;m fatter and balder.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Happy 5th birthday Sebastian! =D <a href="http://t.co/YB39Me0toF">pic.twitter.com/YB39Me0toF</a></p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/361317421191139329">July 28, 2013</a></blockquote>


<h2>On Making Friends</h2>

<p>I joke a lot about not having friends and being alone, but in reality I
have a lot of really awesome people in my life. It wasn&rsquo;t a resolution
of mine to make new friends or be more outgoing, but that was definitely
one of the themes for me this year. The <a href="http://beerlington.com/blog/2013/08/15/a-reflection-on-organizing-the-burlington-ruby-conference/">conference I organized</a>
was a huge part of that. I&rsquo;ve also been involved in organizing many of
the local software user groups and have met people through those as
well.  I am really looking forward to doing the conference in
2014, and can&rsquo;t wait to share the experience with everyone again.</p>

<h2>Laughter is the Best Medicine (besides Percocet)</h2>

<p>Life is too short to take seriously all the time. Here are a few of my
favorite tweets that still make me chuckle.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>LinkedIn is the most awkward dating site I&#39;ve ever used.</p>&mdash; Peter Brown (@beerlington) <a href="https://twitter.com/beerlington/statuses/331453001178959874">May 6, 2013</a></blockquote>
